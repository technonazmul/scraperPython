12V 105AH Leoch AGM Lead Carbon deep cycle battery â?? LDC105-G27-DT
What Makes Lead Carbon AGMÂ Superior to other AGMs?
Positive Plate
This paste formula used is designed to minimise water consumption providing a longer service life at 1300 cycles at 50%DoD. Designed for deep cycle performance.Negative PlateA unique mixture of carbon and other key additives found in negative material allow the SLCA range to perform in partialstate of Charge (PSoC). This increases charge acceptance, optimises fast charging capability and reduces sulphation (akey reason for premature failure).SeparatorThis range also features a bespoke separator, designed to lower internal resistance, which keeps plates wet, maintainscell compression and prevents acid stratification. Other features include double wrapping which prevents short circuiting.

Description
Trojan Battery Company is the world leader in deep cycle battery technology. Since 1925, Trojan has been a pioneer in the development of superior deep cycle batteries. Decades of experience, on-going research and dedication go into every deep cycle battery we manufacture. You can depend on Trojan to deliver reliable, long lasting, continuous power and exceptional value.
Trojan's dominance in deep cycle products isÂ  the result of years of R & D investment, continuous product testing and adherence to strict manufacturing procedures. Trojan produce CAST grids with heavy WIRE and FRAME design. To each grid, Trojan applies its specially formulated Alpha Plus paste formulation. It?s the optimized paste density of this proprietary formula which provides our products with their superior cycle life.
Another Trojan exclusive is its curing process. Once the grids are pasted, they are placed in specially constructed curing rooms which are temperature and humidity controlled. Then they are slowly cured. This provides Trojan deep cycle plates with the most tenacious active material. Once the plates are cured, they are then hand assembled, sealed and formed. Each step is completed under rigorous quality control standards to insure greater cycle time and battery life.

What Makes Superior Lead Carbon AGMÂ Â Superior to other AGMs?
Positive PlateThis paste formula used is designed to minimise water consumption providing a longer service life at 1300 cycles at 50%DoD. Designed for deep cycle performance.Negative PlateA unique mixture of carbon and other key additives found in negative material allow the LDC range to perform in partialstate of Charge (PSoC). This increases charge acceptance, optimises fast charging capability and reduces sulphation (akey reason for premature failure).SeparatorThis range also features a bespoke separator, designed to lower internal resistance, which keeps plates wet, maintainscell compression and prevents acid stratification. Other features include double wrapping which prevents short circuiting.

Long shelf lifeâ?? Self-discharge < 3% per month at 77oF (25oC).
â?? Batteries will still operate after being in stored for long periods of time such
Durabilityâ?? Excellent vibration resistance.â?? Wide operating temperature range.
â?? They can withstand rough terrain.â?? In cold environments, they are less likely to freeze unlike other batteries.
Clean & Hazard Free Useâ?? No gases are released with proper usage.
â?? They can be used near people and sensitive equipmentâ?? Meets regulation compliance so it can be used in schools, hospitals,airports, etc.

Description
Trojan Battery Company is the world leader in deep cycle battery technology. Since 1925, Trojan has been a pioneer in the development of superior deep cycle batteries. Decades of experience, on-going research and dedication go into every deep cycle battery we manufacture. You can depend on Trojan to deliver reliable, long lasting, continuous power and exceptional value.
Trojan's dominance in deep cycle products isÂ  the result of years of R & D investment, continuous product testing and adherence to strict manufacturing procedures. Trojan produce CAST grids with heavy WIRE and FRAME design. To each grid, Trojan applies its specially formulated Alpha Plus paste formulation. It?s the optimized paste density of this proprietary formula which provides our products with their superior cycle life.
Another Trojan exclusive is its curing process. Once the grids are pasted, they are placed in specially constructed curing rooms which are temperature and humidity controlled. Then they are slowly cured. This provides Trojan deep cycle plates with the most tenacious active material. Once the plates are cured, they are then hand assembled, sealed and formed. Each step is completed under rigorous quality control standards to insure greater cycle time and battery life.
